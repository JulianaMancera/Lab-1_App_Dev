# Lab-1_App_Dev

## Instructions
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will have some HTML in the starter code for this lesson. It contains a blog post with a title, author, and
body. Your job is to add a few variables to the file and use them to display the blog post. You can use the
same text/content or add new content. Define your variables at the top of the file and use them in the HTML
below.

- Add a variable called $title and set it to the title of the blog post and part of the title of the page.
- Add a variable called $author and set it to the author of the blog post.
- Add a variable called $body and set it to the body of the blog post.
- Add a variable called $pageTitle with the string "Brad's PHP Blog | and the title of the blog post.
- You can use concatenation or interpolation to combine the two strings. If you use concatenation, be
sure to escape the apostrophe/single quote in "Brad's".
